        PAYDROP: Your all-in-one tool towards an efficient payroll. Paying by the hour has been the staple way of payroll for as long as anyone can remmber. But is it the best way to compensate your employees for thier work? Let's say you run a business, can you garantee tht your employees are actually earing every penny their getting in their paycheck? Or let's say you are an employee. Do you think that the taks you accomplish day in and day out reflect your paycheck? Well now you can settle your questions with PAYDROP!
How it works: With PAYDROP, paying your employees is as simple as 1-2-3 or in this case, send-complete-verify. You send your employees the tasks they need to complete for the day and you set a amount for it. You can also set the deadline for your employees to complete their tasks. For example, you run a software company and you want your front-end developers to finish polishing up the sites about and contact pages for both desktop and mobile view. Assume that you pay your devlopers 384$ per day (U.S average). You set an amount for each specific tasks that each devloper has to accomplish totalling their daily amount and the deadline for completion for the end of the shift. And finally, you send this to your team and let the challenges begin!
Who is it for: From startups to multi-level corporations, PAYDROP is built to scale with your business!
